## General 
This repository holds the code for the course 'Real-time Web', part of the minor "Webdevelopment" at the [HvA](http://www.hva.nl/) 
 
## Issues 
I highly encourage adding issues to this repo in the case of finding one. I'm always up for improving my code.

### Instagram oAuth authentication
![oauth step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_real-time-web/develop/screenshots/oauth_0_hero.png)
![oauth step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_real-time-web/develop/screenshots/oauth_1_hero.png) 
![oauth step 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_real-time-web/develop/screenshots/oauth_2_hero.png) 

The app is limited due to Instagrams strictness with their API. The app is currently is [Sandbox mode](https://www.Instagram.com/developer/Sandbox/). 
 
#### TL:DR; 
Firstly, I have to authorize your Instagram account as a Sandbox-user for this app.  
 
Secondly, you have to accept this invitation [here](https://www.Instagram.com/developer/clients/Sandbox_invites/). Note that you have to have developer account at Instagram to view this page. 
 
Great! You should be able to now go through the oAuth flow. Final thing though. The posts on Instagram that can be accessed in the app is limited to the posts of the Sandbox users. This means that the stream won't show new posts at a crazy rate, because their are a few users, the Sandbox users, that post. 
 
This should al be fixed when the app is authorized by Instagram, which is a pain in the butt. Please accept this for now. 

### Show user's latest post and all the used hashtags 
![hashtags dashboard page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_real-time-web/develop/screenshots/app_0_hero.png)

The user can see the last images they posted to Instagram, inluding the hashtags per post. On a second column, the user can see a list of all the hashtag used in these posts together.

### Open stream with post with the hashtag a user selects through Socket.io 
![post stream selected hashtag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_real-time-web/develop/screenshots/app_1_hero.png)

A user can click on one of the hashtags to open up a stream with post that contain that hashtag. Every X amount of seconds a fresh set of posts is send over the socket connection. Which user gets which posts based on their hashtag is stored on the server side of this application.

### Most clicked hashtags, only sent if new information (MongoDB)
Whenever a user clicks on a hashtag the count for that hashtag goes up. Every X amount of seconds the top ten hashtags get send to the 'Top Hashtags By Users' section. Each time, the server will check whether the information is identical to the previously send information. If this is true, nothing will be sent. The storing of this data happens with MongoDB.

### Service Worker and Progressive Webapp
![service worker in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_real-time-web/develop/screenshots/sw_0_hero.jpg)

If connection between the client and the server is lost the Service Worker kicks in. It will display a user with feedback about what possibly happend. It will also link to Instagram's hashtag search page so the user can still look at the posts for that hashtag.
 
## Live Demo 
Taken al this in account, you can view the app [here](https://minor-webdev-real-time-web.herokuapp.com/).
